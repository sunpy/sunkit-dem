Installation
============

If you want to help develop sunkit-image, or just want to try out the package, you will need to install it from GitHub for the time being.
The best way to do this is to create a new python virtual environment (either with ``pipenv`` or ``conda``).
Once you have that virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/sunpy/sunkit-image.git
   $ cd sunkit-dem
   $ pip install -e .
